# GNN-for-linear-optimization

This is an alternative implementation built from scratch of the model explored on the paper [On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=cP2QVK-uygd), whose original code can be found [here](https://github.com/liujl11git/GNN-LP).

I made this for the final project of the machine learning course at college, and [this](https://github.com/wellington36/Solving_Linear_Programs_with_GNN) is the repository with everything that my group made.

Here I'm planning to improve the code and (try to) make it useful to work together with existing algorithms to solve linear programs.
